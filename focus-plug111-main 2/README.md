## Technical Details

### Website Blocking
The app uses macOS's built-in content filtering capabilities to block websites during focus sessions. In development mode, it simulates blocking by logging to console.

**Note**: For full website blocking functionality, the app requires:
- Admin privileges for hosts file modification
- Or integration with macOS Screen Time APIs
- Or a Network Extension for content filtering

### Music Integration
- Scans local music library automatically
- Supports MP3, M4A, WAV, and AIFF formats
- Includes curated focus playlists
- Can be extended to support streaming services

### Data Persistence
- Uses UserDefaults for lightweight data storage
- Tracks productivity statistics locally
- No cloud sync or external data collection

## Development Notes

### Building
The app is built using Swift Package Manager and can be opened in Xcode or built from the command line.

### Code Signing
For distribution, you'll need:
- Apple Developer account
- Code signing certificate
- Notarization for macOS Gatekeeper

### Permissions
The app requests:
- Notification permissions (for session alerts)
- File system access (for local music scanning)
- Network access (for future streaming features)

## Roadmap

- [ ] Advanced website blocking with Network Extension
- [ ] Spotify/Apple Music integration
- [ ] Cloud sync for cross-device statistics
- [ ] Custom focus session templates
- [ ] Team/collaborative focus sessions
- [ ] Screen time integration
